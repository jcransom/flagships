## Research questions and aims

My research question is: _What is the role of ‘flagship’ universities in the development of sub-Saharan African city regions, in particular the University of Rwanda in the City of Kigali?_

My sub-questions are:

1. How do African flagship universities conceptualise their role in society, and specifically in their city regions, and is this role evolving?
2. To what extent and how do African flagship universities coordinate or participate in development-focused activity in their city region?
3. What role does the University of Rwanda play in the development of the City of Kigali, and what is the relationship between the University of Rwanda and the city council?
4. How does the role of the University of Rwanda in the City of Kigali compare with that of flagship universities in other African city regions?
5. To what extent are global discourses and policies shaping the local engagement activity of the University of Rwanda and other African flagship universities?

The research questions are designed to generate new knowledge to further our understanding of flagship universities and local development at city region level. In doing so the research will need to recognise the institutional complexity of universities, and the possible contestation, or lack of coordination and awareness, within universities. The same applies for the national and local governance structures that oversee and influence university activity. In answering the research questions, my objectives are:

1. To revisit and to understand the distinctive contribution of African flagship universities.
2. To gauge the effects and outcomes of local development efforts undertaken by flagship universities, and the influence of global discourses around development and higher education on local activity.
3. To use the knowledge generated to conceptualise drivers, opportunities and obstacles and inform the local development efforts of universities and governments in other city regions.
4. To contribute to the debate over the role universities can play in development, in particular within their local area.
