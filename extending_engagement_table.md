# Extending local engagement: twelve examples

Twelve ideas are illustrated below, with examples given of how each can be extended and then embedded further within the regional economy. As activities progress, they could start to involve a wider range of local partners, focus more attention on the broader determinants of health, begin to shift from a reactive to proactive approach to improving health outcomes, and adopt a longer-term perspective.

| **1.** Senior officials in anchor institutions (such as hospitals, universities and local government) in Yorkshire and the Humber meet regularly to discuss joint work.                          | Extend the range of connections by introducing counterparts beyond senior leadership teams. Deepen relationships by, for example, hosting joint events. Look to understand the diverse languages and cultures of different sectors. Bring communities, businesses, further education colleges and other partners into the discussions.                                   | Develop and sustain joint activity, particularly around vital areas such as long-term workforce development and skills, working with communities, and collective engagement with other regions, national government and international partners. Ensure leadership is visible and open to debate and scrutiny. Consider secondments or jointly-funded positions to increase cross-sector working and understanding, and build future career pathways. Share experiences and lessons learned from outside the region. |
| **2.** Pilot projects launched with local stakeholders - businesses, the NHS, local authorities, education partners - aimed at improving health outcomes for people in Yorkshire and the Humber. | Be aware of communities that may inadvertently be excluded from new initiatives, and work to include them. Scale up successful activity across the most appropriate geography (which could be pan-LEP, or at neighbourhood level). Be wary of ‘pilot fatigue’ – the time and commitment needed for even small projects – and provide support to encourage participation. | Learn from what works and integrate into future initiatives. Share what has worked – and what has not – with other regions. Funding streams are developed to support future locally-led pilot activity designed by communities, businesses and others to enhance health outcomes, and scale up where successful.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **3.** Regional partners in Yorkshire and the Humber bid collectively for national or international funding for local projects with a focus on health outcomes (see part four for more on this). | Full range of local partners consulted in project design and delivery, including businesses, communities and other education providers. Activity aligns with the specific health needs and opportunities of Yorkshire and the Humber, and includes places not traditionally the focus for research and development initiatives.                                          | Non-anchor partners proactively shape future activity, supported by anchor institutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **4.** Anchor institutions increase budgets or dedicate funding for projects aimed at achieving more inclusive growth and improved health.                                                       | A long-term perspective is adopted, and plans are made for the sustainability of new activity and initiatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Focus (and budgets) shift from reactive to proactive activity: resources are used to prevent ill-health rather than reacting to or treating outcomes. Over time this is likely to be in areas that are further removed from health treatment, such as housing, transport, and social and cultural amenities.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **5.** Areas of overlap and alignment between regional sectoral structures and strategies are identified (in particular the three Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships/Integrated Care Systems, the four local industrial strategies and other sub-regional strategic plans, and at least five Civic University Agreement signatories in Yorkshire and the Humber), plus the Leeds Anchors Network. | Joint activities developed from areas of overlap, and external funding sought where appropriate to fund (or match fund) this. Gaps identified, and especially local groups of people that are not adequately covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Future structures and strategies are co-designed. Areas of alignment with neighbouring regions identified, and complementary activities developed with other regions across the UK.                                                                                                                        |
| **6.** Anchor institutions in the region adopt agendas such as inclusive growth and environmental sustainability in developing policy documents and strategic plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Efforts are translated into tangible outcomes and goals, such as widening access to quality jobs and reducing air pollution. A broad range of local stakeholders are mobilised to shape future planning. Isolated or marginalised communities are consulted at the start of planning processes, with universities and hospitals part of these efforts. Documents and plans are accessible, concise and progress is regularly communicated. Generic concepts (such as inclusive growth) are defined and adapted to local contexts. Health is a common thread throughout. | Anchor institutions assist (and learn from) other partners such as businesses in integrating relevant growth, health and sustainability agendas into their planning.                                                                                                                                       |
| **7.** Partners in Yorkshire and the Humber advocate national policy changes to boost the health of the region’s workforce and build healthy communities (such as promoting the living wage, or alternative measurements to GDP for attracting investment and measuring prosperity).                                                                                                                          | Health is included as a key outcome in regional policy responses to national initiatives such as local industrial strategies, with active involvement of the NHS and other regional anchors in shaping these responses. The ‘regional voice’ in national policy discussions is strengthened by partners working together on responses, developing shared positions, and communicating these clearly.                                                                                                                                                                    | Efforts are made to ensure health in all economic development policies is the norm at national as well as local level link.  This involves including the voice of local businesses (and national/international businesses with a regional presence) in collective lobbying efforts to national government. |
| **8.** Regional partners measure and capture data on outcomes and progress related to health and wellbeing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Establish baselines and consult widely on what should be measured. Try to ensure comparability with existing data sources at regional or national level, and align these with other projects (such as the Data for Better Health and Wealth work across the Northern Powerhouse).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Be aware of, and address, perverse incentives that may arise from capturing data on particular activities (especially where funding is attached) and any neglected areas as a result.                                                                                                                      |

| **9.** Anchor institutions in Yorkshire and the Humber, such as hospitals, universities and local government, consider procuring more goods and services locally.                                                                           | In addition, the social benefit of purchasing decisions is considered (many organisations need to do this as a matter of course through the Social Value Act). Understand and map supply chains, and continue to monitor best practice as this area is likely to become more prominent. Recognise the limitations of approaches to geographically ‘contain’ spending.                               | Where appropriate, work with partners such as businesses and others within supply chains to consider the local and social implications of purchasing decisions. Capture the outcomes of changing spending patterns to improve decision-making and policymaking within and beyond the region.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **10.** Academics and other specialists are involved in tackling local health challenges.                                                                                                                                                   | Students and industry partners are also involved in designing and implementing responses. Work is done with rather than for or to communities. This work includes activity, such as citizen science, related to examining the social determinants of health, in particular things like improved housing.                                                                                            | There is a programme of work on anticipating and proactively responding to long-term challenges to health and wellbeing in the region, and communicating challenges and opportunities with partners within and beyond the region. A stronger focus on ‘place’ is promoted as a determinant of national research and innovation funding and activity. Yorkshire and the Humber should collectively make the case to attract greater investment in R&D and innovation funding for health. |
| **11.** Universities, NHS and local government within Yorkshire and Humber make plans for the better utilisation of estates (buildings and spaces).                                                                                         | Under-utilised estates are opened up for social community use, and buildings adapted to be open and accessible public spaces where appropriate. Any commercial revenue realised from previously under-utilised estates is re-invested, for example into community engagement or public realm improvements.                                                                                          | Future estates developed with health and wellbeing as core design principles, in partnership with a range of local stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **12.** Leaders are aware of future workforce requirements – including the provision of NHS health and social care workers – and anchor institutions promote efforts to maintain healthy and productive workforces in Yorkshire and Humber. | Anchor institutions – in particular NHS and education providers – coordinate to meet future workforce needs (building on findings from, for example, the Topol Review).  Work is aligned with other policy areas (especially those necessary for retaining skilled staff: housing, transport, cultural amenities, schools). Tensions between short-term needs and longer-term planning are managed. | Future skills shortages are anticipated through effective use of labour market intelligence and planning, and gaps in capacity are addressed by greater collaboration and integrated support for career pathways. Businesses lead regional initiatives to improve the health and wellbeing of their staff, with the involvement of anchor institutions.                                                                                                                                 |
